# Web-Scraping-Challenge
Note that Selenium may be required to run some of the code used. Try running either: "pip install splinter[selenium3]" or "pip install splinter[selenium4]" in your terminal/GitBash, in your virtual environment of choice.  
  
To begin, open and run the code contained in "mars_data_challenge_part_1.ipynb". This will scrape the article titles and previews on the landing page of https://redplanetscience.com/ and store these in a Python dictionary. This will then be exported to a .json file in the "Outputs" folder.  
  
Next, open and run the code within "mars_data_challenge_part_2.ipynb". This will scrape the data from https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html into a Pandas dataframe, make adjustments to datatypes, and then perform analyses on this data. Refer to the comments in the code for the questions, and see the outputs and visualisations, as well as each of the Markdown cells for the answers to these questions. Finally, the dataframe will be exported to a .csv file in the "Outputs" folder.
